== About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/ Computer Science and Engineering] at the [http://www.umich.edu/ University of Michigan], advised by Professor [http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jiadeng/ Jia Deng]. My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning.

I interned at [https://research.google.com/ Google Research] in Summer 2017, [https://research.adobe.com/ Adobe Research] in Summer 2016, and [http://daqri.com/ DAQRI] in Summer 2014.

Before starting my Ph.D., I received an M.S. in [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/ece/ Electrical Engineering: Systems] from the [http://www.umich.edu/ University of Michigan] in 2013, and a B.S. in [http://www.ee.nctu.edu.tw/ Electronics Engineering] from [http://www.nctu.edu.tw/ National Chiao Tung University] in 2009. During Summer and Fall 2013, I was a visiting student researcher at [http://www.stanford.edu/ Stanford University], supervised by Professor [http://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/ Silvio Savarese]. From 2010 to 2011, I worked as a research assistant at [http://www.sinica.edu.tw Academia Sinica], advised by Dr. [http://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/ycwang/ Yu-Chiang Frank Wang]. 

Thanks to Google for a [http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2016/03/announcing-2016-google-phd-fellows-for.html Fellowship] supporting my research!
