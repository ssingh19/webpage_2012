== About Me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/ Computer Science and Engineering] at the [http://www.umich.edu/ Univeristy of Michigan]. I am advised by Professor [http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jiadeng/ Jia Deng].

My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning. I received my M.S. degree in [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/ece/ Electrical Engineering: Systems] from the [http://www.umich.edu/ Univeristy of Michigan] in 2013, and my B.S. degree in [http://www.ee.nctu.edu.tw/ Electronics Engineering] from [http://www.nctu.edu.tw/ National Chiao Tung University], Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009. During the summer/fall of 2013, I was a visiting student researcher at [http://www.stanford.edu/ Stanford University], under the supervision of Professor [http://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/ Silvio Savarese]. From 2010 to 2011, I worked as a research assistant at the [http://www.sinica.edu.tw Academia Sinica], Taipei, Taiwan, where I was advised by Dr. [http://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/ycwang/ Yu-Chiang Frank Wang].
